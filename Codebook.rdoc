== Code Book for the wearable computing project(run_analysis.R)
This is the code book for the raw to tidy data transformation. This process is carried out by the run_analysis.R script 
that extracts raw data from different files in UCI HAR Dataset directory were the wearable computing project data is located

== Meta-data (Raw data)

* General Description (Extracted from the documentation of the data set).

The data was extracted from the url: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
and it has multiple variable values corresponging to the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" project.
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 
they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers 
was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

== Observations (Raw data)
* Even the subject number goes up to 30 there's only 21 subjects.
* The quantity of observations per each activity is not the same for all subjects. In other words if there are four observations 
for any subject in "WALKING" activity there are more o less than four observations in other activities.
* The files with the name y_train and y_test suits the activities performed for each subject.
* Even the angle variables were calculated with the mean of other variables (gravityMean, tBodyAccMean, tBodyAccJerkMean, tBodyAccJerkMean, tBodyGyroMean, tBodyGyroMean, tBodyGyroJerkMean) they're not used to concieve the tidy data set

== Meta-data (Tidy data)

== How the run_analisys script works?
=== Parameters
This function has only one parameter and it's the path where the UCI HAR Dataset directory is located. If the parameter is ommited
the "getwd" function is used to get the default working directory configured in R.
=== Process
* Invoking Libraries
  The code starts with a notification, then it loads the libraries
    message("Executing! please wait...")
    suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
    suppressMessages(library(plyr))
    suppressMessages(library(base))
    
* Step 1. Verifies the files existence
It uses the...
  if(!file.exists(paste(c(rds_path,"/UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt"),collapse=''))){
    message("subject_test.txt is not available! Please check the directory path.")
    return(FALSE)
  }
  
* Step 2. Check the number of rows for y_train(Activites), subject_train and x_train)
It uses the...
  df_actdstr <- read.table(paste(c(rds_path,"/UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt"),collapse=''))
  df_subdstr <- read.table(paste(c(rds_path,"/UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt"),collapse=''))  
  df_valdstr <- read.table(paste(c(rds_path,"/UCI HAR Dataset/train/x_train.txt"),collapse=''))
  
Then it...
  if(nrow(df_actdstr) != nrow(df_subdstr) | nrow(df_valdstr) != nrow(df_subdstr)){
    message("The files in train directory don't have the same number of observations!")
    return(FALSE)
  }
  
* Step 3. Check the number of rows for y_test(Activites), subject_test and x_test)
It uses the...
  df_actdste <- read.table(paste(c(rds_path,"/UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt"),collapse=''))
  df_subdste <- read.table(paste(c(rds_path,"/UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt"),collapse=''))
  df_valdste <- read.table(paste(c(rds_path,"/UCI HAR Dataset/test/x_test.txt"),collapse=''))
  
Then it...
  if(nrow(df_actdste) != nrow(df_subdste) | nrow(df_valdste) != nrow(df_subdste)){
    message("The files in test directory don't have the same number of observations!")
    return(FALSE)
  }
  
* Step 4. Binds (Merges) the training and the test sets to create one data set
It uses the...
  df_acticom <-rbind(df_valdstr,df_valdste)
  
* Step 5. Set the Variable(column) names
It uses the...
  df_varname <- read.table(paste(c(rds_path,"/UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt"),collapse=''))
  df_varname <- df_varname$V2
  df_varname <- gsub("[[:punct:]]", "", df_varname)
  colnames(df_acticom) <- df_varname
  
* Step 6. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
It uses the...
 
  df_data <- df_acticom[,-(461:502)]
  df_data <- df_data[,-(513:519)]
  df_data <- tbl_df(df_data)
  df_data <- cbind(select(df_data,contains("mean",ignore.case = TRUE)),select(df_data,contains("std",ignore.case = TRUE)))

* Step 7. Changes de activities code number by their description
It uses the...

  df_actlb <- read.table(paste(c(rds_path,"/UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt"),collapse=''))
  df_joacttr <- suppressMessages(join(df_actlb,df_actdstr))
  df_joactte <- suppressMessages(join(df_actlb,df_actdste))
  df_acticom <- rbind(df_joacttr,df_joactte)
  colnames(df_acticom) <- c("Activity_code","Activity_desc")
  
* Step 8. Merges the activites with the data set
It uses the...

  df_data <- cbind(select(df_acticom,Activity_desc),df_data)
  
* Step 9. Extract the subjects and sets the Variable (column) names
It uses the...

  df_josucom <- rbind(df_subdstr,df_subdste)
  colnames(df_josucom) <- c("Subject_num")

* Step 10. Merge the subjects with the data set
It uses the...

  df_data <- cbind(select(df_josucom,Subject_num),df_data
  
* Step 11. Detach package plyr to use summarize properly
It uses the...
  detach("package:plyr", unload=TRUE)
  suppressMessages(library(dplyr))

* Step 12. Create the file with the tidy data
It uses the...

  gr_subacmen <- df_data %>%
  group_by(Activity_desc,Subject_num) %>%
  summarise_each(funs(mean))
  message(paste(c("Creating secondary tidy data set in ",rds_path,"/tidymeanset.txt"),collapse=''))
  write.table(gr_subacmen, file = paste(c(rds_path,"/tidymeanset.txt"),collapse=''),row.names = FALSE)
  message("Process succesfully finished!")
  return(df_data)
